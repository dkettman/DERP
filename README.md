# DERP 
## Dave's Emacs Resource Pack

### Pre-Requisites
First, you will need emacs installed! (duh?) This does not do that. This is **ONLY** files for you .emacs.d file.

If you are running Windows, do not fret! This should work for you! You just need to make sure you have a reasonable installation of emacs installed.

### Installing Emacs
#### Windows
To install Emacs on Windows, your best bet (to get all features working nicely) is to get a zip file from the emacs-w64 project on SourceForge. As of this writing, the latest version is [here.](https://sourceforge.net/projects/emacsbinw64/files/release/emacs-w64-25.1-O2-with-modules.7z/download) Once downloaded, extract it anywhere you have write access to. To add it to your start menu, run the 'addpm.exe' in the bin directory. 

#### Linux
Usually, just use your package manager, otherwise, I think you are able to figure it out :)

### Installing DERP
1. Clone this repo somewhere
2. Copy the .emacs.d directory to your home directory.
  * Windows: C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming
    * Make sure you keep the initial '.' of the directory name!
  * Linux: ~/
3. Start Emacs and enjoy!

### What's in it?
*SSSSHHHHHH!* It's a secret!

### CTL-specific stuff?
Yeah, have that too!

```
C-c 1 -- Open Remedy case in default browser. Does not have to be full number, it will figure it out.
C-c 2 -- Open Vantive VMAC in default browser.
C-c 3 -- Open Huge VMAC Calendar.
C-c 4 -- Open Vantive VMAC in Emacs in all text.
